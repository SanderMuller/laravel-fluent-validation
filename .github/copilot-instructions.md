# Release Automation

## CHANGELOG.md is updated automatically — do NOT edit by hand for releases

`CHANGELOG.md` is kept in sync with GitHub releases by `.github/workflows/update-changelog.yml`. When a release is published (not just drafted), the workflow uses `stefanzweifel/changelog-updater-action` to prepend the release body to `CHANGELOG.md` and commits the update back to `main`.

This means:

- **Do not** add changelog entries manually when preparing a release. The release body (drafted in `internal/release-notes-<version>.md` and pasted into the GitHub release) becomes the changelog entry automatically.
- **Do not** include a changelog diff in the release PR — the post-release commit comes from CI.
- If the changelog needs a fix *after* a release, edit `CHANGELOG.md` directly and commit — but this is unusual and only for typos or formatting issues in the auto-generated entry.

## Benchmark table in release body is updated automatically

`.github/workflows/release-benchmark.yml` appends the latest benchmark table between the `<!-- benchmark-start -->` / `<!-- benchmark-end -->` markers in the release body after publish. Do not paste benchmark numbers manually into the release body with those markers — write the narrative above and let CI fill in the table.

## Release workflow (summary)

1. Draft release notes in `internal/release-notes-<version>.md`
2. Commit and push code + notes file to `main`
3. Tag and create the GitHub release with the release-notes file as the body
4. CI automatically:
   - Appends the benchmark table to the release body
   - Prepends the release body to `CHANGELOG.md` and commits it back to `main`

No manual `CHANGELOG.md` edits are part of the release PR.

## Verification Before Completion

Before claiming any work is complete or successful, run the verification command fresh and confirm the output. Evidence before claims, always.

### Required Before Any Completion Claim

1. **Run** the relevant command (in the current message, not from memory)
2. **Read** the full output
3. **Confirm** it supports the claim
4. **Then** state the result with evidence

### During Development (after each change)

| Claim            | Required verification                              |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Code style clean | `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` output    |
| Tests pass       | Related tests pass via `--filter` or specific file |
| Bug fixed        | Previously failing test now passes                 |

### At Completion Only (feature/phase done, before PR)

These are slow checks — only run them once at the very end:

| Claim             | Required verification                                           |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Rector ran clean  | `vendor/bin/rector process` showing 0 changes                   |
| PHPStan clean     | `vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --memory-limit=2G` showing 0 errors |
| Full suite passes | `vendor/bin/pest` output showing 0 failures                     |
| Feature complete  | All above checks pass                                           |

### Always Capture Command Output

Append `|| true` to all verification commands (tests, linting, type checks) so the output is always captured, even on failure. Without it, a non-zero exit code can hide the output, forcing an expensive second run just to read the errors.

```bash
# CORRECT — output always visible
vendor/bin/pest --filter=testName || true
vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent || true

# WRONG — output lost on failure, wastes time re-running
vendor/bin/pest --filter=testName
```

### Never Use Without Evidence

- "should work now"
- "that should fix it"
- "looks correct"
- "I'm confident this works"

These phrases indicate missing verification. Run the command first, then report what actually happened.
